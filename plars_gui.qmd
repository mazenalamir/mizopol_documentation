The datasets used in the video bellow are described in the [KAGGLE repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mazenalamir/dataset-for-nonlinear-state-estimator-design) dedicated to the Machine Learning nonlinear state estimator design. 


The dataset contains two examples where the **features** are represented by the past measurements instances over a so called *observation horizon* while the **label** is the value of the state at the present instant.
