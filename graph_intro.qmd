***

The graph of sensors interconnection enables to visualize through a condensed view what are the currently available relationships between the sensors. 

This makes it possible to immediately see patterns showing which subsets of sensors are *intimately linked*. These links might be implied by the physical laws that govern this subset of sensors according to explicit relationships that hold independent of the context of excitation and use.

The graph of the sensors interconnection is available for the **g2sys** module and the GUI associated to the **pwpol** module as well.

Below is an example of a Graph view resulted from the use of **g2sys** in exploring the 
relationships that hold in a hydraulic rig system[^rigseelater]:

From this graph, the following facts can be infered: 

1. There are three sensors appearing as the labels in **recursive relationships**. These are the sensors labelling nodes with thick boundaries, namely: `PS1`, `PS4` and `PS6`. 

2. There is a **static relationship** that provides `PS2` as a function of `PS1` and `PS3`.

3. `EPS1` statically depends on `PS1` and nothing else. 

4. `PS6` is an autonomous (probably oscillator or periodic variable). 

5. `PS4` appears in a recursive equations but it does not depends on itself. Probably `PS4` has the same derivative than `PS6`. Moreover, `PS4` is not needed to build the simulator of the system as it does not impact any of the other sensors while it is dynamically *intimately* linked to `PS6`.

Notice that for the graph to be relevant, sensors should not have two relationships in the folder of models. In other words, for each sensor, there is **at most** one relationship where the sensor plays the role of a label.

Notice also that the distinction into **recursive** (or dynamic) and static relationships holds only for the graph of models that are designed using the **g2sys** module. Those built up using the **pwpol** module does not show this distinction. 

For a video showing the creation of such a graph on the hydraulic rig system, please refer to the [graph on the hydraulic rig system](graph_zema.qmd) section. 

It is also shown later on that the graph of models built up using **g2sys** might facilitate the design of an associated **digital twin** as it is discussed in details in the [digital twins](digital_twins_intro.qmd) section.
