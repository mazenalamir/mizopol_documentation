subtitle: Overview of the section

***

The rationale behind the need for **piece-wise polynomial** representation has already be discussed and explained in [piece-wise polynomials section](pwpolynomials.qmd). 

In a nutshell, these relationships enable to handle non purely polynomial dependencies (trigonomic, rational fractions, exponential to cite but few ones), but **more importantly**, they enable to handle multiple context of use where the nature of relationships changes drastically. 

Searching for piece-wise multi-variate polynomials can be done using the **pwpol** module of the **MizoPol** suite of tools. 

Nothing can be better than specific use-cases studies where instantiations of such circumstances are studied. 

In the present section, we shall consider the following sets of use-cases:

**The manipulator robot case** 
: Where the precision of the residuals when standard multi-variate relationships are identified by the **pwpol** module and the ones that might be obtained used piece-wise polynomial are compared. 

This use-case is detailed in the [robot use-case](pwpol_robot.qmd)

**The anaesthesia dataset**
: Where it is shown how the **pwpol** module can be used to *characterize the normality* over a large number of datasets coming from operation rooms enabling the detection of anomalous events during the surgery depsite the wide class of operations type and medical staff. 

This use-case is detailed in the [anaesthesie use-case](pwpol_anaesthesia.qmd)
