In this section, we recall some definitions related to multi-variate polynomials as the latter are in the heart of the **mizopol** package.

## Definition {#sec-poldef}

- Let us assume that $x\in \mathbb R^n$ is an $n$-dimensional vector of features. 
- A multivariate[^multivariate] polynomial in $x$ is a scalar map $P(x)$ that takes the following form:

$$
P(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n_c} c_i\phi_i(x)\quad\text{where}\quad \phi_i(x) = \prod_{j=1}^{n}x_j^{p_{ij}} 
$${#eq-defdepol}

where each $\phi_i$ in @eq-defdepol is called a **monomial**. 

- The degree of monomial $\phi_i$ is defined by the sum of its powers, namely: 

$$
\texttt{deg}(\phi_i) = \sum_{j=1}^{n}p_{ij}
$${#eq-degphi}

- The degree of the polynomial is the maximum degree of its monomial, namely:

$$
\texttt{deg}(P) = \max_{i=1}^{n_c}\Bigl[\texttt{deg}(\phi_i)\Bigr]
$${#eq-degP}

## Representation {#sec:polrepresentation}

From the very definition of a monomial $\phi_i$, it comes out that its contribution to the expression of the polynomial $P$ is entirely defined by the following attributes: 

1. The vector of powers $p_{ij}$ for $j\in \{1,\dots,n\}$ (these are integers)
2. The coefficient $c_i$ that is associated to the monomial 

In other words, the information associated to $\phi_i$ takes the following form:

Now since the polynomial $P$ involves $n_c$ monomials, it comes out that $P$ is totally determined by its power matrix and its associated vectors of coefficients as it is shown in the following figure (see also @eq-defdepol):

## Example 

The following script shows the use of the above representation in defining a polynomial and evaluating its values on a matrix of features. This script uses the `polyval` function of the `utilities` module of **mizopol**.


```python
import numpy as np 
from utilities import polyval

nx = 6
nt = 10000

# Generate data 
X = np.random.rand(nt, nx)
y = X[:,0]**2 -3*X[:,1] * X[:,3]**3 + 4 * X[:,5]**5-1

# Define the powers and the coefficients of the polynomial 
P = [[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
     [0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5], 
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ]

c = [1, -3, 4, -1]

# Predict the value of the polynomial at X
# and compare to the true value
ypred = polyval(X, P, c)
print(abs(y-ypred).max())
