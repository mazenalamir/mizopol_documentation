**MizoPol** is a set of python modules[^mizopol_suite] that addresses the problem of  **identifying (piece-wise) polynomial relationships** between time series. This identification is detrimental in solving the following problems:

[^mizopol_suite]: **MizoPol** is not rigorously speaking a *python package*. This is the reason why it is referred to as a *python suite* or a *set of modules*. Nevertheless, it is possible that the work *package* is used here and there by mistake.

- Anomaly detection by normality characterization 
- Understanding the coupling between sensors beyond linear correlations
- Identifying dynamics governing nonlinear unmodelled systems
- Creating virtual sensors
- Generating parametric subtil defaults to auto-train models 
- help designing digital twins

:::{.callout-note title="Domains of application"}
Achieving the above listed tasks paves the way towards addressing many important domains of interest in industry such as:

- Predictive **maintenance**. 
- Nonlinear **control design**. 
- State / parameter **estimation** of nonlinear systems.
- Introducing relevant **parametric anomalies** beyond bias or relative error
- **Context** detection.

We'll come back to these applications as we explain the different modules and their illustrative use-cases.
