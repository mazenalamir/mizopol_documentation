It is uselful to understand the principle of the `plars` algorithm as this paves the way to a better understanding of the input arguments involved in the modules' call. 

A more detailed presentation is provided in [@alamir2025Book].

The following features come out directly from the principle sketched above: 

:::{.callout-note title="Randomness & scalability"}
The process inside `plars` involves an amount of randomness due to the randomly selected `nModels` windows. Consequently, the solution returned is never rigorously the same. 

Notice however that the random windowing process is in the heart of **the scalability** of `plars`.

## Input arguments 

From the above principle, it comes clearly that the call of `plars` need the following arguments to be provided: 

`X`
: Feature matrix 

`y`
: Label vector 

`window`
: The size of the window (integer) representing the number of **subsequent** rows to be selected for the current partial fit. 

`deg` 
: The degree of the polynomials used in the monomial selection process.

`nModes`
: Number of monomials to be extracted at each partial fit. 

`nModels`
: Number of repeated rounds of random selection  of working window. 

`eps`
: Targeted precision impacting the number of monomials retained in the final solution. 

These are the input arguments that directly follows from the principle of the `plars` modules, other arguments are also possible to use in order to orient the execution towards some specific objective. 

Further description of the input arguments is provided in the [example](plars_example.qmd).

## Returned solution 

Notice that according to the principle exposed above, the solution consists in the list of monomials with their associated coefficients. This is precisely what is needed to define the **sparse** multivariate polynomial, solution of the regression problem stated in [Problem statement section](plars_intro.qmd#problem-statement).

As a matter of fact, the returned solution, say `sol` is a dictionary that contains many *keys*, among them, `powers` and `coefs` are available to represent the fitted polynomial. 

Further description of the returned solution is provided in the next section that proposes a simple illustrative example.
