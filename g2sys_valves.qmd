**indus_focets** Dataset
: This is a true industrial dataset that is made anomymous to meet an industrial partner.

***

The data set addresses the problem of discovering relationhips between many sensors placed on industrial valves. Many physical sensors are involved such as: **currents**, **voltages**, **torques**, **pressure** and differential pressures. 

 | **21** sensors | **870,000** rows |
