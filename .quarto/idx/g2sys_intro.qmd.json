The Newton's law can be written as follows: \n\n$$\n\\dfrac{dv}{dt} = K\\theta-\\lambda_f v^2\n$${#eq-car-newton}\n\nIn this example, we dispose of two sensors: \n\n$$\ns_1=v\\quad \\text{and}\\quad s_2=\\theta\n$$\n\nLet us try to analyze what happens when we try to exhibit (*discover*) relationships when successively using $i=1$ and $i=2$.\n\n#### Case where $i=1$ \n\nIn this case, one is targetting relationships on the sensor $$s_1=v$$ As mentioned, above this can be static or dynamic. \n\n##### Static relationships\n\nIn this case, one is looking for a relationship of the form: \n\n$$v_k=P_1(\\theta_k, \\theta_{k-d}, \\dots, \\theta_{k-n_d\\times d})$$\n\nwhich is obviously **non existant**.
