abstract = {This paper addresses the characterization of normality in industrial robots which is a crucial step in anomaly detection without an a priori knowledge of the set of faulty behaviors. This is done using piece-wise multi-variate sparse polynomials involved in the identification of implicit relationships between sensors measurements. These relationships are then used to design tight residual generators for complex dynamical systems such as multi-link robot manipulators. An algorithm is provided and tested using real data collected on a 4-link Staübli robot. The precision of the residual is also compared to the one that might be obtained using the state-of-the art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) showing higher precision with far less complexity and drastically lower computation time. Moreover, some examples of use of the resulting residual generators in anomaly detection are provided showing promising preliminary results.}

	abstract = {In modern anesthesia, multiple medical devices are used simultaneously to comprehensively monitor real-time vital signs to optimize patient care and improve surgical outcomes. However, interpreting the dynamic changes of time-series biosignals and their correlations is a difficult task even for experienced anesthesiologists. Recent advanced machine learning technologies have shown promising results in biosignal analysis, however, research and development in this area is relatively slow due to the lack of biosignal datasets for machine learning. The VitalDB (Vital Signs DataBase) is an open dataset created specifically to facilitate machine learning studies related to monitoring vital signs in surgical patients. This dataset contains high-resolution multi-parameter data from 6,388 cases, including 486,451 waveform and numeric data tracks of 196 intraoperative monitoring parameters, 73 perioperative clinical parameters, and 34 time-series laboratory result parameters. All data is stored in the public cloud after anonymization. The dataset can be freely accessed and analysed using application programming interfaces and Python library. The VitalDB public dataset is expected to be a valuable resource for biosignal research and development.},

abstract = {Reconstructing high derivatives of noisy measurements is an important step in many control, identification and diagnosis problems. In this paper, a heuristic is proposed to address this challenging issue. The framework is based on a dictionary of identified models indexed by the bandwidth, the noise level and the required degrees of derivation. Each model in the dictionary is identified via cross-validation using tailored learning data. It is also shown that the proposed approach provides heuristically defined confidence intervals on the resulting estimation. The performance of the framework is compared to the state-of-the-art available algorithms showing noticeably higher accuracy. Although the results are shown for up to the 4-th derivative, higher derivation orders can be used with comparable results. An associated python module is made available via: pip install ML_derivatives.}
